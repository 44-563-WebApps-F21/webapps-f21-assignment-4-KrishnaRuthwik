            <h5 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5>  
            <p class="speech">I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I suppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,
                when you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are going to say, so I don’t feel alarmed. </p>
                <p class="stage-direction">[_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]</p>  
                <p class="speech"> Ah! dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear. </p> 
                <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] </p>
                <p class="speech">Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant way in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.</p>
                <p class="stage-direction">  [_They sit down_.] </p>
                <p class="speech"> And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?</p>

<h5 class="name ARBUTHNOT">MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h5>
  <p class="speech">I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

<h5 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h5> 
 <p class="speech">Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?</p>

<h5 class="name ARCHDEACON">ARCHDEACON</h5>  
<p class="speech">She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas. But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched
    the tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other amusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.</p>
